-whenever im using chem:smiles=cco: or use any string, and i try new rendering options like show carbon, methyl, aromatic rings, i believe it tries using chem:mol=cco: thats why it says render failed in pubchem??? but it doesnte ven make sense why is it trying to use pubchem, for smiles all the client does is put the smiles in the server link, and puts thelink in the iframe, like chem:mol=cco: it doesnt happen everytime but its very common it shos an error not rendered in pubchem
-also this is happpening with iupac names too not just chem:smiles=cco: when i tried chem:iupac=1-chloro-ethane: it also shows render failed in pubchem, but it should be using opsin not pubchem
- same problem again whenever i increase teh 3d viewer size, it shows render failed in pubchem inside the iframe basicalyl whenever the molecules reload some of the molecules are incorrectly getting directed into using a mol= format instead of iupac= or smiles= id assume this would happen to minerals and stuff too so the  extension should be using smiles= or iupac= instead of switching to mol= either that ist he problem or the server is using pubchem instead of smiles or iupac on reloads

for my next request, i want you to make it so that the discord link is sent from the server, the discord link the default settings, like the server will say to the client hey i have updated the new client settings if it doesnt receive that message from the server the client, the client isnt actively looking for that message  right like the patch notes are also like this they are actively fetching from the server instead of just storing it, i believe there should be an easier solution where everytime theres an update the client recieves a ping or something about it but after second thought im not sure if its  safe approach because someone might abuse it and send this signal form like a fake server idk im nott sure but to get like text everytime is from the server puts load on the server, like the patch notes, as soon as i change it in the server or a .js file or like i change the discord link the server will send the client the discord link IT WILL NOT REDIRECT because a lot of people dont trust these redirects they will get a discord link, same goes for default rendering options i believe right now theyre a specific theme or a specific 3d viewer size i can change these default themes from the server and it will update the client side, BUT the new default settings it recives for like rendering options shouldnt just reset their settings it should only apply to those who havent changed their settings at all, so goes for the UI options for both dark and white mode both of which should be editable like the background popup UI, this default settings can be easily changed instead of reluploading the whole extension only for it to go through a 3 day review process just for some settings if its safer and better to use the way the patch notes work like fetching newoptions real time i guess we can do that its up to you though
