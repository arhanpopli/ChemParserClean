How to use flags

Chem:nomenclature:

+3d = switches to 3d mode, can be used with other flags for the 2d image, basically this shows the 3d model first if you have this flag instead of the image, however image flags like c, h, m can be used
st = stereochemistry image
d = default, used like this chem:histamine/d-c+m+h+q-p: basically adds or removes specific settings from the default image settings
p = flip vertical
q = flip horizontal
c = show carbons
h = show hydrogens
when used like chem:histamine/+c+h:, it overrides default settings and uses the settings only after the / which would be show carbons and hydrogens

Make the extension directly fetch from PubChem it uses a bridge server at 5002 → ![Mdma](http://localhost:5002/pubchem/img/Mdma?size=large) and PubChem images dont load when i load the extension and when im switched to PubChem it loads the 3d models directly not the images it should load the PubChem images, first find out how molview renders minerals in the 2d sketcher then you will make 2d view thing like smiles you will use that to make the 2d image like molview does for its 2d images and can you make it in the search api you will add a place for the 2d "3d screenshot for biomolecules" so biomolecules cant be rendered really using smiles or whatever so its best to just make an image so they dont have to view a 3d model to view it, so molview will make an image for a specific like it renders links it will make an iamge from the 3d model and that image will be used in the iframe by default and i can press the 3d button at the top right to switch to actual 3d view, also for efficiency purposes it should be preffered that like the image is an svg or something because obviously the 3d model has fixed colors if its an svg then it will not take that much space so by effectively doing this youre removing that option when you click the play button the play the 3d, because minerals will have 2d images like bond lines and stuff also host mol2chemfig on port 1000 or something

also i made a GitHub repo that can actually render aromatic rings hydrogens carbons like m2cf so it wont have to be dependant on mol2chemfig for advanced stuff so what are possibilities of integration 

also some of the molecule that just go randomly in the background just keep spinning in circles sometimes they need like some other molecules coming from the ends whilst a molecule leaves which adds new momentum like at the same probability a new molecule can enter leave it shouldn't just appear randomly it should come from the side and the molecule that gets away shouldn't just disappear it naturally go the side but it should look like its being pulled to the corner or the side

also problems with moleculeviewer sometimes when the moleculesize is kinda large it becomes like REALLY REALLY large its size shouldn't increase linearly with the size of the molecule it should increase like a parabola only the first half of the parabola like it increases then its rate of increase in size with respect to the actualy size of the molecule decreases

the unified html looks really ugly gemini make me fully polished website for QuintessenLabs and anyone can access those pages update the unified html if youre gonna make a new one then make one with all the tabs, make it look professional tell them about my version of molview called QLabs - molview modified and QLabs - smilesdrawer which has hydrogens, and carbons rendered "C:\Users\Kapil\Personal\PROJECTS\Chemparser\UniversalSansDisplayGX.woff2" "C:\Users\Kapil\Personal\PROJECTS\Chemparser\UniversalSansItalicDisplayGX.woff2" you can use these fonts to to like add weights and stuff its a gx font so you will have a lot of options, make a smilesdrawer page too it will be empty for now but it will use my modified GitHub repo, again make it look amazing use the colors Like lightish purple for the Quintessentext and soft white color for white but mostly like fight but just like a little hint of yellow but very minute and in the QuintessenLabs text add like a light effect going through the text like to give it a shine and it goes away but just an animation
