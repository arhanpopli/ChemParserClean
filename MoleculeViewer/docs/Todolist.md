TO DO
Please first take steps for each todo thing to make it so that you can test it easily yourself

Extension
- add an option for images in the bottom 
left corner one up arrow and one down arrow each time you click it the image increases by a little bit or the box does so you can configure each images size, and in developer options there it show two options to enable one to save size config for each image and there should ev another option that when you enable the previous option you can enable this option that saves the same image size for each molecule/svg, so forexample if I have histamine and I decreased the size of the box when I reload I will see the same size of histamine that I configured previously the firstnoption will be only for the page I configured for, and the second applied to all pages
- by default the svgs mol2chemfig generates are too small make them as big as the ones moleculeviewer makes, I know I think it just generates a smaller svg so you'll just need to increase the box size by default
- mol2chemfig svgs aren't changed to the color of the black line to white in darkmode and vice versa

Extension UI 
-make 10 versions of different UIS for the popup while keeping the options in intact so if can pick the ones I like it shouldn't be like just the color is different

Mol2chemfig/moleculeviewer/ servers
- there should be separate moleculeviewer cache link folder and so for mol2chemfig
- UI when I apply settings doesn't show me a separate svg link under download svg link, for example I hit the chemfig options I want those options to save, but they don't save, I want it so when I hit search and convert again it uses the options instead of me manually having to hit apply options, and after hitting apply options even right now it won't show me the cache link
-add a new server called pubchem this will be the same option meaning it doesn't depend on us hosting servers not really if our servers go down the sinplet server will be the one that Just redirects image links from pubchem into the extension, for example, the extension might even be able to natively support this, so the extension or a server goes to pubchem searches for like histamine or something IT will find the image for it and place the image link instead of the chem:histamine: so the server or extension won't have to do anything but it won't have the options like aromatic rings etc, but it might I'm not sure, pubchem also has 3d models with a lot of options, so maybe you can put them instant of the chem:nomenclatureorchemicalname: and also the options for them like animated show hydrogens or sticks option or space filling option or ball and stick option it's available on the pubchem so maybe it can extract the 3d model if the page can't take the link for the 3d model if it even has one I know if you go into network you can see the 3d models there so maybe it can extract it maybe extracting it wont be needed in just giving ideas https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pcfe/structure-3d-webgl/structure-3d-webgl.min.js
If this works the extension should put a button in the top right button when you enable it shows you 3d view
- in mol2chemfig add option to enable 3d nomenclature it fetches the smiles from opsin website maybe there's a 3d smiles option O=C[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)CO, make it so that this option can also be enabled in the extension
- better cache system or optimised I've seen duplicate files for example for moleculeviewer ive seen that it stores one svg separately even if they have the same smiles formula one svg is stored as ethanol something another even though the same smiles format is stored as the "smileformat" like CCO
- moleculeviewer isn't working for specific compounds, I think it's because it can only show the links of the svgs it has already generated it's not making an svg that hasn't been generated for it in the extension
- finally divide the moleculeviewer and mol2chemfig and pubchem into multiple servers or if pubchem will even be a server maybe it can be integrated in the extension itself I talked about this previo
