## 🚀 What You Need to Do

### **Only 1 Thing (Really!):**

Keep Flask server running in a terminal window:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Kapil\Personal\PROJECTS\Mol2chemfig\MoleculeViewer"
python run_server.py
# Leave this open!
```

## 💬 Give Me Work

### **Easiest Way:**
```
"Work on: [feature name]"

```
