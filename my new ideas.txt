so to take this to the next level we will get chatgpt to use options or flags itself

so for example instead of thisnormal string it generates chem:histamine: it can now control the options for each individual option like it can do chem:histamine/+c+o+m+n+: they can be in any order these are the basic flags we can also have it be like we can also make it use the flip or flop flags -p -q respectively so it can do this for each image individually instead of us having default settings it can have an invert flag, inv, and a size flag +s100, 100 representing the max size, a rotate angle flag the extension will handle the rotation, r60, 60 representing angle in degrees, a 3d flag but the 3d flag shouldn't contain any other flags because they wont work with 3d, it will show the molview 3d view using +3d, I was also thinking I could still have my default options  but it could do something like this we have a default flag that will use my default settings it will be d, no it would be just next to the slash like chem:phenol/d-c: say for a specific setting or the way I asked a question I don't wanna see the carbons but my default settings is d chatgpt could do d-c and remove the carbon from that image using that flag it could like do -c or -m  so chem:phenol/d: will never use my default options unless the d is in the colons, however if the user doesn't want to use ai things then there will be an option in the popup saying AI mol control or something, if i have that enabled then ill have to have d in my chem:randomnomenclature/d: and only then my settings will be applied but if that setting is disabled chem:randomnomenclature: will still use the normal settings, if you dont want ai to resize your image and stuff, obviously when you do +r60 or +s10 that will override the default size or rotation settings
also i believe there are some flags that  moleculeviewer can also use like size and rotation, and 3d because i mean 3d is hosted by molview doesn't need PubChem or anything else

so if it will be able to control the size rotation flipping vertically etc for each image and 

also problem with PubChem first of all i see console there are some molview scripts being injected so the extension is clearly trying to inject a 3d model in the viewer but i dont see it, also the 3d viewer is weird it like its too big and in the chatgpt bubble it escapes size from the bubble its and then the way the box is generated it just looks so off and scuffed and then the image is placed in the 3d box which doesn't need to happen
second PubChem has one 2d image and one 3d image, there should be an option what to use be default for PubChem options
third add a toggle option that makes the extension fetch for the images instead of us having to make a bridge server, if that works then we wont need to transfer the PubChem stuff to the extension then to the page we can do it directly from PubChem them to extension to the page, when the PubChem option is enabled, and also PubChem actually has a white background the images it has they have white backgrounds so make it so that the extension makes the white background disappear or it removes it to make it transparent, and when its dark mode it makes the black part or some colors that are black enough white and when its light mode then it keeps them black but also removes the background ONLY DO THIS when the remove-bg option in PubChem options is enabled in the extension otherwise keep the image as is that it got from PubChem, the option doesn't exist yet so make it
